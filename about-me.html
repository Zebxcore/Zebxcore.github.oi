                        My name is Sebastian Cortes. I am 24 years old and I am from Colombia. <br>
                        I major in Electrical Engineering but I developed a passion for coding so I decided to take a minor in Computer Science.
                        As of September, 2021, I am a Senior and about to go through a major change in lifestyle after I graduate next Spring.<br>
                        In hopes of findign a job and produce for a couple years, I have been developed my skills in many different areas and skills across different fields 
                        in order to provide my best to my future employers, and employees if I ever decide to open a company myself.<br><br>
                        I will update this section regularly just to give an insight of who I am, what my life expectations are, my dreams, wishes and more. :)
