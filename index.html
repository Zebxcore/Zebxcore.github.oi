          Milestone Week #1
        </h2>
        <p>
          <br> * I've been talking with friends that are Software Engineers working for actual companies already for the most part
          <br>   without adding much to my portfolio this week. They were helping me with the basics of HTML, CSS and some Typescript.
          <br> * I have watched a couple Youtube videos on HTML like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE&t=1194s"> this one </a>
          <br>   were the explanations were easy to understand and directions were easy to follow.
          <br> * I worked on Git as well. I spent quite some time playing around with shell commands and installing the required software for the course,
          <br>   like NodeJS and Git. I linked everything to VSCode and now I just work from VSCode without the need to open GitHub.
          <br> * I went over all the documentation for HTML <a href="https://htmlreference.io/"> here. </a>
          <br> * I barely went over the documentation for CSS <a href="https://cssreference.io/"> here. </a>
          <br> * Most of the HTML I wrote for this website either came from <a href="https://marksheet.io/html-syntax.html"> here</a>,from the advice of a couple friends on 
          <br>   how to style and make things look "nicer" or from the video mentioned above.
          <br> * Used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_two_columns.asp"> this</a> website to build a flexbox for my picture and the Introduction to my website using some basic CSS and HTML.
